# Unicord.Universal.Voice
This is the home of Unicord's Voice implementation, in essence, it's a C++/WinRT port of D#+'s VoiceNext, as well as a UWP IBackgroundTask to handle connecting to voice in the background.

It's important to note that C++ isn't a language I'm partcularly used to, so when contributing, please keep this in mind, and add comments where appropriate.
